    <h1>How to tie shoe laces</h1>
    <p>In this website, I will tell you how to tie your shoes if you don't know how. If we know how to tie our shoes, we don't have to walk with our shoes untied. To tie your shoes, we just need 2 materials.</p>
    <p>Materials needed:</p>
    <li>Shoe</li>
    <li>Shoelaces</li>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>We should first make an "X" with shoelaces.</p>
    <img src="Step 1.jpg" alt="Step1">
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Hold the end of under lace and put it in an "X" made by the laces, inside it.</p>
    <img src="Step 2.jpg" alt="Step2">
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>We pull it hard so that the laces won't get loose.</p>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>We hold the laces and fold about 1/3 of it.</p>
    <img src="Step 4.jpg" alt="Step4">
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Hold those folded laces and make an "X" again.</p>
    <img src="Step 5.jpg" alt="Step5">
    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    <p>Hold the end of the under lace and put it in "X" as we did in Step 2.</p>
    <img src="Step 6.jpg" alt="Step6">
    <h2>Step 7</h2>
    <p>Don't pull it hard yet. We should find a part where the lace won't come out even if you pull.</p>

    <h2>Step 8</h2>
    <p>Once you find that part for both sides, then pull it as hard as possible to hold it tight.</p>
    <img src="Step 8.jpg" alt="Step8">
    <h2>End</h2>
    <p>If you correctly followed all these steps, you will have tightly tied shoelaces.</p>
    <h3>Then it's finished!</h3>
